# cobol-text-analyzer

I modernized a cobol text analyzer by updating its code and making it run better.

Just run `make` to create the executable and then run `./wordStat` to run the program.

You can even run `make old` to generate an executable that can run the older cobol script.
This can be done by running `./stat` however the text file that this script reads is hard coded
so you would have to change the name of the text files or the code if you want it to analyze different text.

You can also run `make clean` to clean up the directory.
